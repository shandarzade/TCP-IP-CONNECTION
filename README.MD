# DEVICE COMMUNICATION

## Project description 

   * This project involves creating a system that can handle real-time data communication between a manufacturing plant's devices and a central management unit. The system must be capable of supporting multiple devices, each potentially using different communication protocols for reading and writing data. The main objectives are to facilitate communication via TCP/IP, handle multiple devices simultaneously, support future protocol additions, and provide a framework for testing and validation.
